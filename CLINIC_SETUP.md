# Mobile App Clinic Setup

## ðŸ§¹ Clean Clinic Integration

The mobile app has been updated to work with the new clinic setup from the dashboard.

### Changes Made

1. **Removed old clinic setup script** (`scripts/addClinics.js`)
2. **Updated clinicsService** to remove sample clinic creation
3. **Removed development buttons** that added sample clinics
4. **Updated AppContext** to not initialize clinics automatically

### How It Works Now

1. **Clinics are managed by the dashboard** - The dashboard setup script creates the 4 clinics
2. **Mobile app reads from Firebase** - No automatic clinic creation
3. **Consistent data structure** - Both dashboard and mobile app use the same clinic format

### Available Clinics

The mobile app will display these clinics (when added via dashboard):

| Clinic | Email | Password | ID |
|--------|-------|----------|-----|
| Soweto Community Clinic | soweto@clinic.com | 123456 | clinic1 |
| Alexandra Health Centre | alexandra@clinic.com | 123456 | clinic2 |
| Diepsloot Primary Healthcare | diepsloot@clinic.com | 123456 | clinic3 |
| Sandton Medical Centre | sandton@clinic.com | 123456 | clinic4 |

### Setup Process

1. **Run dashboard setup script** first:
   ```bash
   cd clinic-dashboard
   node scripts/setupClinics.js
   ```

2. **Start mobile app**:
   ```bash
   cd clinicconnect-app-Main
   npm start
   ```

3. **Verify clinics appear** in the mobile app

### Error Handling

- If no clinics exist in Firebase, the mobile app will show an empty state
- The app gracefully handles missing clinic data
- No automatic clinic creation to prevent conflicts

### Benefits

âœ… **Single source of truth** - Dashboard manages clinics
âœ… **No duplicate clinics** - Clean data structure
âœ… **Consistent experience** - Same clinics across platforms
âœ… **Better error handling** - Graceful degradation
